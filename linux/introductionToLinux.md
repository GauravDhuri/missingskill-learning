## Extra
 
This comes as shock to many people that 'Android' one of the most popular mobile operating system is based on Linux . But do not misunderstand what that line means.

So, What does it mean when we say 'Android is based on Linux'? Here, when we use the word 'Linux' we mean the 'Linux kernel' (A kernel is the core part of an OS)
