## Functions

A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. The main purpose behind creating/using a function is that we can reuse the code as many times as we want, this helps use save time and also helps us make our progams compact.

Syntax of a function is :

```
 function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3){
   // code to be executed
 }
```
Think of function like a food recipe.

Eg :- Making a sandwich. The ingredients will be the parameters and the code will be the procedure we use on the ingredients and this procedure when performed should result us with a output which is a sandwich. 
```
makeSandwich(onion 🧅, bread 🍞, tomato 🍅, cheese 🧀){
 let sandwich = 🧅 + 🍞 + 🍅 + 🧀;
 return sandwich 🥪;
}
```
