# <span class="header">Introduction to Git</span>

So, Firstly What is Git ? Git is one of the most popular Version Control System.

>A Version Control System records the changes made to our code over-time and stores it in a speical database called repository.

We can often look at our project history and see who has made what changes , when & why. One of the biggest advantage of Git is that if we do something wrong we can easily revert our project back to earlier state. Now before we go futher, we need to know what category of version control git falls into as this will help us understand the advantages of Git in more detail.

There are basically two types of version control system :

| Centralized | Distributed |
| :---------: | :---------: |
| In a Centralized System , all members connect to a central server to get the latest copy of the code and to share changes with others | In a Distributed System, every member has a copy of the project with its history on the machine so we can save snapshots of our project locally on our machine |
| eg : Subversion , Microsoft team foundation server | eg : Git , Mercurial | 
| Problem with Centralized System is the single point failure, if the server goes offline we cannot collaborate or save snapshots of our project so we have to wait until server is back online | In Distributed System such kind of failure cant occur since ever member has a copy of the project on his/her local machine and if the server is offline we can synchronize our work directly with each other |
